# Agent Deliverables Directory

This directory stores detailed outputs and deliverables from each specialized agent working on the RAG system production readiness project.

## File Naming Convention

Use descriptive filenames that clearly indicate:
- Agent role (e.g., `backend-`, `qa-`, `performance-`)
- Deliverable type (e.g., `analysis`, `implementation`, `report`)
- Scope or component (e.g., `workflow`, `testing`, `deployment`)

Examples:
- `backend-workflow-analysis.md`
- `qa-test-coverage-report.md`
- `performance-benchmark-results.md`
- `system-designer-architecture-review.md`

## Integration with Session Context

All files in this directory should be referenced from the main `session_context.md` file to maintain traceability and ensure findings are incorporated into the overall project context.

## Agent Guidelines

1. **Store comprehensive details** here while keeping session_context.md updates concise
2. **Use markdown format** for consistency and readability
3. **Include timestamps** and agent identification in each deliverable
4. **Reference source files** and provide specific file paths for any recommendations
5. **Append findings** to session_context.md after storing detailed analysis here
