PWR 2: The Rhetoric of Global Health | Spring 2025 

Dr. D | Stanford University

## Research-Based Argument 

Final Written Project 

  

Your RBA is the final written product for PWR 2 – the fulfillment of the research project (RP) you proposed in Week 4 of the quarter. You will support your argument using a variety of academic and non-academic sources. 

  

You will need to include background information to help the reader contextualize the argument and/or understand why it is important. The majority of the essay, however, will be devoted to presenting the components or facets of your argument. Please remember that strong arguments are nuanced; they make limited rather than broad claims and often include evidence to address contrary or alternative perspectives (counter-arguments).

  

The RBA makes an argument, but it can be an argument to further the conversation - to enrich and complicate it, not to end it. Given the short time between now and the end of the term, you will need to think strategically at every step. To this end, think depth, not breadth. Many of you started this process attempting to cover a lot of ground. As you move toward completion, your job is to stake out a small space and drill down deeply -- as deep as you can go. The more we know about real problems, the thornier they become. The richness - the thorniness of your problem - should emerge on the page. 

  

Consider what you’d like your audience to know, understand, believe, and/or do after reading your work. Remember that in general, we use language in order to “get things done” -- to shift conversations and shape our world. 

  

One final note: the written RBA in PWR 2 constitutes a major assignment. To earn a satisfactory grade, students must complete both draft and revision. Failure to complete both of these components to the instructor’s satisfaction will result in a grade of “NP”.

  

#### Length/ Parameters

- 10-11 ish pages = 2500-3500 words +/- 10%, excluding works cited, captions, foot/end notes
    
- At least 1 visual, skillfully integrated into the text (most of you will need and want to use more)
    
- Double spaced, 1" margins, standard 12 point font and formatting, page numbers, and a thoughtful title
    
- Works Cited/ Bibliography - correctly formatted in APA, Chicago, or MLA format
    
- 15 sources (minimum)
    

#### Target Audience

- The community of scholars, researchers or intellectuals you wish to join. 
    
- A group in a position to do something - take up your suggestion, amplify your call to action, etc. 
    
- Alternatively, a public (think of long-form journalism) impacted by your problem or case study.
    
- Something else you can make a case for 
    

  
Think about who you would like to reach with your work and how you want your audience to re-think a problem and/or its solution. Your word choice, style, and citation format should bear this audience in mind. 

  

Four questions to address as you draft and revise 

1. How is your project related to but distinct from others’ projects in the field? What is new? If there is a gap in the literature, how does your project aim to fix it? 
    
2. How will you get your message across to your chosen audience? Think in terms of genre or format. Where does your target audience get their information? What kinds of writing and research do they deem authoritative?
    
3. This class has introduced you to the Biosocial framework of understanding global health, but if you think back to the Textual Analysis presentations there are [many others](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mKHzf11sKhq37v1rbAP6wr69JKeST9pJ?usp=drive_link)! What is your theoretical or methodological approach to the issue? What sort of "lens" will you apply to guide your focus?
    
4. What is the exigence for your writing, and how does the broader sociocultural context - in your field or the world generally - inform your work? In other words, what is the urgency? 
    

In many ways, we’ve already done much of the difficult conceptual work in the RP. The next step is to continue your research and develop a thesis, claim, argument, intervention, or solution to the problem you have identified - even if it’s just that there is a “gap in the research” - and then support that with sufficient, directly relevant data/evidence. Your draft must address the four questions above.

  

Important Dates: Rough Draft, Revision, Review, Final Draft

  

- The final bibliography table is due Friday May 9th. 
    
- The [Stakeholder Bio](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1OJ-y0Et-TpOXnuvngt49mvyPG6t0wg8tjetJHc9sIGM/edit) is due Monday May 12. 
    
- We will conduct a peer review workshop on the first rough draft in class on Wednesday May 14. 
    
- You will add a “notes to self” entry to your journal and submit the draft on the 14th as a work in progress.
    

  

As you develop the RBA, you’ll also be developing your Oral Delivery of Research (ODR). Through this dialectic of drafting-revising-presenting, you’ll further refine your essay. 

  

Ultimately, you will be ready to present your final, polished project in both forms to your target audience. The ODR will take place during class time during weeks 9 - 10. Your revised written draft will be due at the end of week 11.

  

## Learning Objectives

As the capstone assignment for students in PWR 2, the Research-Based Argument aims to synthesize many of the research and writing skills we have been developing throughout the course:

- continue to develop confidence in researching
    
- develop, refine, and revise viable research question(s)
    
- develop, refine, and revise a complex argument
    
- practice articulating your own scholarly motives and rhetorical stance and recognizing those of others
    
- practice finalizing a large-scale project
    
- learn about your own methods of research and reflect upon strengths and areas for improvement 
    
- consider the needs of your reading audience
    
- employ the relationship between “oral delivery” of research and “written delivery” to deepen your thinking about your topic

PWR2TD: Rhetorics of Global Health

Dr. Tara Dosumu Diener

Funding the Unfunded: Decentralized Science to Close the Health Equity Gap

The Problem:

In just two centuries, humans have seen an incredible leap in extending longevity. Back in 1900, the average person barely lived 32 years; today, we’re at more than 71 years globally. It’s astounding – no country even reached 40 years of life expectancy in the early 19th century, yet now places like Japan and Switzerland annually exceed 82 years (World Health Organization). We can thank healthcare innovation for this miracle – antibiotics, vaccines, better surgeries, and diagnostic tech not only added years but made them worth living for the globe. A meta‑review by Kaplan and Milstein (2019) showed how advances in medical devices and treatments have dramatically improved both lifespan and quality of life. Just immunization alone saved 154 million lives over the past 50 years, adding 66 years of healthy life, while vaccines prevent around 2.5 million deaths each year (Bloom et al. S93‑S94).

Yet these extra decades aren’t shared equally. In Sub‑Saharan Africa, life expectancy sits at just 62 years, which over two decades below the Organization for Economic Co‑operation and Development (OECD) average. Within Western Africa, it drops even lower to 57.7 years, showing just how deep this gap runs. The difference between Switzerland (~83 years) and Nigeria (~54 years) means a three‑decade survival penalty. Medical breakthroughs don’t just automatically spread worldwide. This gap in health outcomes directly connects to how research money is distributed. In 2020, institutions in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs) got just 0.2 % of all grant funding for non‑communicable disease research (World Health Organization). An analysis calls funders the “missing link” for equity, showing how LMIC researchers face structural disadvantages in almost every major funding competition.

This disadvantage is what health experts call the “10/90 gap” – less than 10 % of global health research spending focuses on diseases and conditions that cause more than 90 % of preventable deaths (Lewis 5). A Nature study that mapped 4.5 million grants found that 67 % of dollars stay within the donor’s own country or even university campus, making geographic inequalities worse (Halffman and Leydesdorff 1362). Behavioral research shows that donors in both public and private sector prefer causes that are “close to home,” therefore putting to the side Global‑South priorities (Small et al. 215‑217).

Decentralized science (DeSci) can offer innovative pathways to democratize research funding. By utilizing community‑driven structures – such as open‑access decentralized fundraising, quadratic funding, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for governance, token‑based incentives, and quadratic funding – these structures can mobilize resources worldwide with transparency and inclusivity. This leads to my research question: How can DeSci and blockchain technologies offer a more equitable, efficient, and decentralized path to fund healthcare research in under‑resourced regions?

Literature Review:

The 10/90 gap in global health research isn’t new. Back in the 1990s, the Commission on Health Research for Development first documented it – less than 10 % of worldwide research resources were being applied to health problems in developing countries, even though these regions accounted for over 90 % of preventable deaths (Commission on Health Research for Development). It’s been three decades since then, and we’ve barely made any progress. Stephen Lewis found most published research still focuses on diseases common in rich countries, which neglected tropical diseases get little attention despite affecting huge populations (Lewis 5‑6).

The WHO’s Global Observatory on Health Research & Development keeps tracking these disparities. Their 2023 analysis showed that institutions in LMICs received just 0.2 % of all grant funding for non‑communicable diseases research (World Health Organization). This is particularly harmful because these regions now have to deal with both infectious diseases and rising rates of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease (World Health Organization).

So why does this inequity persist? Several analysts point to structural barriers. Major funders like National Institutes of Health (NIH), Wellcome Trust, and even the Gates Foundation tend to fund institutions in their home countries. The grant application process itself is stacked against researchers from poorer regions as they favor those with long publication histories in prestigious journals and sophisticated grant‑writing support. Review panels often prioritize research questions relevant to wealthy populations rather than issues with the greatest global health impact (Chu et al. 327‑329).

Inspecting how research is typically funded, we can identify three main mechanisms, each one has problems that make the 10/90 gap worse. Government grants make up the largest share of health research funding globally. These come through agencies like the NIH and the US. While this funding can be substantial, it’s mostly directed toward institutions in those countries. Political considerations often influence decisions, and the rigid application processes favor established researchers at prestigious institutions. The timeline from application to actually getting money frequently exceeds 9‑12 months, which creates major cash‑flow problems for smaller institutions especially in LMICs (Moses et al. 1339).

The second mechanism relies on philanthropic foundations like Gates, Wellcome, and Chan Zuckerberg. These foundations are usually more willing to fund research in poor countries than government agencies, but they still show geographic biases. Foundation grants often require partnerships with institutions from wealthy countries, which downgrade LMICs researchers to being “local implementers” rather than scientific leaders. Decision‑making stays concentrated among foundation boards and executives and receives little input from the affected communities (Yamey and Feachem 1057‑1059).

Thirdly, private pharmaceutical companies fund the majority of healthcare research in the world. However, their funding is even more skewed, focusing almost entirely on diseases with commercial market potential. Pharmaceutical companies allocate less than 1% of R&D spending on neglected tropical disease – conditions that affect over a billion people (Trouiller et al. 20188‑2194).

Within these traditional systems, researchers from poorer countries face particular disadvantages. Even when they do receive funding from international collaborations, they often have less decision‑making power, lower compensation, and fewer publication opportunities than their partners from wealthy countries (Crane et al. 103‑105). The application process itself creates barriers – complex online portals, requirements for expensive preliminary data, and the need for extensive publication histories pretty much shut out many qualified researchers from LMICs.

Despite three decades of reform efforts (what), the distribution of global‑health research money ever remained lopsided. Conventional mechanisms – government agencies, philanthropic foundation, and pharmaceutical R&D – continue to channel resources toward priorities of their home constituencies. This inequity has prompted scholars to look beyond tweaks in peer‑review or grant‑writing support and question if a different architecture of science finance is required.

Within this landscape of broken funding systems, a new wave of scientists and tech innovators has started rebuilding research finance from scratch. They call it “decentralized science” or DeSci, borrowing tools from crypto and blockchain – public ledgers, smart contracts, token incentives – and applying them for scientific advancement. Early DeSci pioneers argued that if quadratic funding could democratize software development (Buterin et al.), the same approach could match small donations from around the world to health priorities that traditional grant committees usually ignore. Now, in practice, DeSci platforms replace gate‑kept journal review panels with community voting, cut year‑long review cycles down to weeks, and record every transaction/publication on public ledgers so anyone can check and access. By design, they promise what conventional systems failed to deliver – faster moving capital, globally diverse decision‑making, and intellectual property that belongs to communities that fund the research.

What started as theoretical discussions in whitepapers now grew into a full‑fledged ecosystem covering the entire research process in just three years. A December 2024 Messari survey counted more than a hundred active projects covering multiple areas. Funding DAOs like VitaDAO, AthenaDAO, Catalyst collect and distribute community resources. Infrastructure providers like Molecule and BIO Protocol contribute by tokenizing laboratory services and patents. Data platforms like GenomesDAO and Data Lake help participants earn money from their genomic and clinical information. Publishing services like ScieNFT put research on the blockchain. Regional communities like DeSci Africa and Vitalia City bring in local researchers. Together, these projects already gain massive traction – working with millions of dollars, managing patient data, and evaluating real scientific work – completely in public. However, will all of this transparency and community governance just recreate the same power imbalances we already see, or does it actually shift resources and authority to researchers to poorer countries? My comparative analysis deep dive will tackle this question.

Solution:

Building on top of the documented funding inquiries and emergence of DeSci platforms, my research project will test whether decentralized science can truly redirect resources and decision‑making power to researchers in less‑wealthy regions. I’ll conduct a comparative analysis of five DeSci platforms – VitaDAO, ValleyDAO, ResearchHub, and Molecule – against three major legacy funders – the U.S. NIH, Gates Foundation, and Wellcome Trust. Unlike legacy systems, DeSci platforms expose every vote and grant disbursement on the blockchain, enabling systematic analysis of who pays, who decides, and who ultimately benefits.

I selected these five DeSci platforms because each has deployed significant capital and published transparent, on‑chain records that allow external verification. VitaDAO, for example, raised $4.1 million in 2023 with participation from Pfizer Ventures, enabling over 8000 community members to vote on which longevity research would be granted. ValleyDAO issues GROW governance tokens and funds biology laboratories up to $250,000. Gitconi’s quadratic‑funding rounds channeled tens of millions toward public goods projects with full‑grant ledgers published on their governance forum. ResearchHub was recently profiled by Nature for paying reviewers in cryptocurrency, records every paper uploaded on‑chain. And Molecule provides IP‑NFT infrastructure for communities to purchase fractional ownership of patents, transforming scientific intellectual property to collectively owned assets.

My research results use two metrics to anchor my comparison. First, LMICs funding share measures what percentage of total disbursements reach principal investigators or institutions based in the Global South. The WHO’s Global Observatory found that in 2020, LMICs institutions received just 0.2 % of all non‑communicable disease research grants. Second, governance inclusion assesses who makes funding decisions – traditional review panels predominantly come from wealthy universities, whereas blockchain ledgers reveal exactly which wallets (hence geography) cast votes. For legacy agencies, I’ll analyze publicly posted publication review board memberships. For DAOs, I’ll use wallet geolocation data (if available) or use token distribution reports as the diversity proxies.

For data, I’ll utilize open‑source platforms like NIH RePORTER grant files, Gates and Wellcome award databases, DAO governance forums, Gitcoin CSV exports, and smart‑contract transaction logs. The NIH itself describes a standard ten‑to‑twelve‑month timeline from application to project. In contrast, DeSci proposals move from submission to funding within weeks. I will compile quantitative results and trace how money and authority flow through each model. On the qualitative side, I will evaluate proposal discussions and see whether community voting helps surface neglected diseases.

Significance and Implications:

Demonstrating that one decentralized platform delivers a higher share of funding to LMICs research and gives them real voting power would be a breakthrough for the “10/90 gap.” If Molecule’s marketplace can show that African or Southeast Asian laboratories can tokenize early‑stage patents and raise capital without Northern gatekeepers, it would challenge the prevailing pattern where over 99 % of grant dollars of malaria collaborations remain with institutions in donor countries. Nonetheless, if DeSci repeats existing imbalances, such as wealthy “whales” dominating the voting or if grants cluster in rich biotech hubs, my findings provide concrete design warnings for blockchain enthusiasts and philanthropic boards. Either outcome will contribute evidence that senior scholars and global health funders can use when determining where to allocate resources.

The stakes of this research extend beyond creating fairness. Faster, community‑governed financing could allow local scientists to respond to outbreaks before slow grant cycles deliver aid, and could allow patient groups to co‑own the intellectual property behind future treatments. If my comparison reveals that decentralized models already outpace the twelve‑month NIH timeline and direct a larger fraction of funds to researchers closest to the burden of disease, it could justify piloting hybrid mechanisms – such as quadratic‑matched pools or IP‑NFT co‑financing – within traditional agencies. This study will provide scholars, donors, and health ministries with a documented blueprint for closing the research‑equity gap that has persisted since it was first quantified in 1990.

BMJ Global Health, 2(4), e000570.|This source talks about all these problems in global health funding like middlemen taking cuts and fraud that create this big gap in research money. It proposes four ways blockchain could help fix health funding: like direct payments, crypto pools, better tracking for fraud, and markets for health data. I can use these ideas to see if DeSci platforms are actually doing what they claim. The paper talks about how scientists in poor countries could get money directly through crypto instead of waiting forever for regular grants. This source helps me understand how blockchain might make funding fairer by getting rid of middlemen who just take money without really helping. It shows how DeSci might give more resources to researchers in poor countries when the traditional system hasn't worked for them. The paper says blockchain's transparent records could cut down on the 30-40% of health aid that gets lost to corruption and paperwork. It also makes me think about whether decentralized voting can get around the gatekeepers who usually direct money away from diseases affecting the poorest people. The paper mentions this old WHO Declaration from 1978, suggesting fair funding has been promised a bunch of times but never actually happened - which makes me wonder if DeSci is really any different or just hype with new tech. It talks about fraud in traditional funding that I can compare with blockchain's claims about transparency. This other paper by Dimitrov from 2022 criticizes the optimistic view by showing how early crypto health projects failed, giving me a reality check about the gap between what people say and what actually happens.|
|Nature Biotechnology (Editorial) (2023). The community of the DAO. 41: 1357.|This source shows a bunch of examples of these bio-science DAOs that have been growing fast: VitaDAO for longevity, ValleyDAO for climate, AthenaDAO for women's health, and even HairDAO for hair-loss treatments. It talks about how these DAOs get money through tokens and then let the token holders vote on what research to fund. The editorial is pretty positive about DeSci DAOs, basically saying "we should get on board" with this model. It says DAO communities have less bias and fund risky but potentially high-reward ideas that regular funding agencies just ignore. It does mention some limitations though - even the successful ones like VitaDAO still have to constantly look for new funding and members. It shows how regular scientists and patients are taking funding into their own hands, like how ValleyDAO funds climate biotech ideas nobody else would fund, and how people in HairDAO get first access to treatments they helped pay for. This source helps me understand how DeSci and blockchain DAOs create a more inclusive way to fund things. It shows how DAOs are funding research that usually gets ignored, like women's health and climate stuff, and getting global communities involved in making decisions. It talks about how blockchain makes everything transparent so people can see all the transactions and decisions, which builds trust. It basically supports my main research idea that DeSci can fill funding gaps in areas that don't get enough resources by using community money and governance. The editorial mentions some papers about bias in grant funding and even this idea of grant lotteries, showing different ways people have tried to fix funding problems without using blockchain. Some guy named Unfried cited this piece in 2024 when talking about funding models in longevity science, which shows it helped make DAOs seem legitimate in mainstream science conversations. It has this really high Altmetric score (361), which means it's been shared a ton in both academic and DeSci communities, and lots of people reference it when analyzing biotech DAOs.|
|Weidener, L., & Spreckelsen, C. (2024). Decentralized science (DeSci): definition, shared values, and guiding principles. Frontiers in Blockchain, 7, 1375763.|This source defines DeSci, a new field with little formal research. The authors surveyed 39 practitioners (finding only 7 scholarly articles) to identify core principles like blockchain transparency and community governance. I'll use their definition to frame my research on how these principles might reshape scientific funding. This directly connects to my research question by showing how DeSci might distribute funding more fairly to under-resourced regions through community governance that bypasses traditional gatekeepers. It gives me concrete concepts to evaluate whether DeSci implementations actually improve equity and efficiency in global health funding. The paper balances academic perspectives with community voices, citing both Shilina's research and JocelynDAO's critiques. As one of the first comprehensive definitions, newer studies are already building on its analysis of tensions between decentralization and science.|
|Unfried, M. (2024). Advancing longevity research through decentralized science. Frontiers in Aging, 5:713354.|This source shows some examples of DeSci working in longevity science, looking at these DAOs like VitaDAO that funds aging research, AthenaDAO for women's health, and CryoDAO for cryopreservation stuff. It shows how these DAOs have raised money for projects that normal grants would've just ignored, and how VitaDAO's community manages intellectual property for potential treatments. The article says DeSci could make science more fair and efficient, especially for fields like longevity research. It says blockchain and DAOs make funding faster and more willing to take risks on high-reward research that traditional funders won't touch. It talks about how science progress has slowed down even though we're spending more money on it, with studies showing we're getting "less bang for its buck" and how aging research specifically doesn't get enough funding. This source helps me understand how DeSci could make health research funding more fair and efficient. It uses longevity science as an example of research that doesn't get enough money and shows how DeSci helps overcome funding barriers. It shows equity through community-driven funding for stuff like women's health and aging research that usually gets ignored, and efficiency through faster funding cycles compared to traditional grants. This applies pretty well to global health since both longevity and many diseases in poor regions don't get enough funding from traditional sources. The article mentions these studies on scientific stagnation by Bloom and Park that show how throwing more money at science hasn't actually led to more breakthroughs - which challenges this idea that just adding money fixes everything. It mentions Stewart & Plotkin who think science should be improved through better theory and replication instead of fancy new funding technology. It also talks about this EU open science initiative by Budroni that improves data sharing without using blockchain, showing there are other ways to fix science funding besides just blockchain. These different perspectives balance out all the pro-DeSci arguments and show there are multiple approaches to fixing science funding.|
|Díaz, F., Menchaca, C., & Weidener, L. (2025). Exploring the decentralized science ecosystem: insights on organizational structures, technologies, and funding. Frontiers in Blockchain, 8, 1524222.|This source looks at a survey of 49 DeSci organizations and shows they mostly use Ethereum, but most of them haven't really gone full DAO yet and a lot of them still work with traditional institutions. The authors say even though DeSci is growing, it's got these big challenges where a lot of projects are still pretty centralized. It's kind of ironic that these alternative funding projects often can't even fund themselves properly, which seems like a pretty basic problem to have. This source helps me see that DeSci isn't really fully decentralized or self-sustaining in real life, so maybe it needs to work with traditional funding to actually make a difference in under-resourced regions. The paper talks about all these governance issues and funding limitations that answer my questions about risks, but it also says community-building is a strength for including diverse participants from around the world. The study mentions some blockchain basics and science reform literature stuff while showing this big gap between what DeSci claims to be and what it actually is in practice. By pointing out how most projects haven't fully adopted DAO governance, it shows these tensions between the purists who want complete decentralization and the pragmatists who are more practical. It references some previous failures to explain why some organizations keep more centralized control, which makes sense when you think about it.|
|Rawat, S. (2025). Decentralized platforms upending how synthetic biology is done. SynBioBeta (Feb 25, 2025).|This source tells Maria's story of getting screwed by traditional publishing and starting a DeSci platform to give researchers ownership. It shows ValleyDAO using tokens for decisions and IP stakes in projects like engineered yeast, and deScier letting researchers publish as NFTs. It claims these platforms help scientists in poor countries get funding without needing elite connections. This connects to my research by showing how traditional funding ignores researchers in developing countries and diseases affecting the poor. ValleyDAO funds climate projects faster than grants, suggesting similar models could work for global health. But token-based ownership might bias funding toward profitable projects rather than basic science needs. The article uses personal stories instead of citations, matching criticisms about how publishers exploit researchers. It mentions neglected diseases without citing the 10/90 gap literature directly. It admits many DeSci projects aren't fully decentralized yet, so complete decentralization probably isn't realistic anyway.|
|McFarlane, C. (2025). Longevity vs DeSci: Web3's growing influence in healthcare. Forbes (Jan 31, 2025).|This source shows some examples of DeSci in healthcare, especially this group called VitaDAO that's raised money for aging research. It shows how people who fund the research get to vote on projects and stuff. It argues Web3 is changing how healthcare research works by making it more about what patients want. It also explains why longevity research and Web3 go together - they both need new ways to get money since traditional approaches don't work great. This article helps me understand how DeSci might make healthcare funding better. It shows how funding can happen faster and how communities can support diseases that big companies ignore. It looks at longevity research as an example, which is kind of like global health problems since they both don't get enough money. It mentions some risks too like regulation problems and crypto being unstable. This article doesn't have real citations since it's from Forbes, but it uses different viewpoints. It talks about VitaDAO's real work and probably uses some market data about the longevity industry. It probably has some academic voices to sound legit. It's been mentioned in newsletters and conferences, which shows people are paying attention to it. It's good for my research because it explains Web3 stuff in a way that makes sense for healthcare.|
|Kiani, L. (2025). Beyond cryptocurrency: how blockchain is transforming science, research and biotech funding. Signals Blog (CCRM), May 8, 2025.|This source explains various blockchain funding mechanisms for science including ICOs where research teams issue tokens, STOs offering regulated equity, NFTs representing intellectual property rights, and DAOs with community treasuries. It argues that blockchain creates a more inclusive research ecosystem by enabling scientists to pitch directly to global supporters rather than navigating traditional grant bureaucracy. The blog demonstrates blockchain's evolution beyond cryptocurrency into practical research funding solutions, facilitating faster transactions and utilizing smart contracts for automated milestone-based disbursements. This source shows how researchers outside the elite institutional bubble can actually get funding and how people affected by specific diseases can have real input on what gets studied. It demonstrates efficiency improvements through significantly accelerated fundraising cycles and reduced administrative overhead via smart contracts. The variety of mechanisms presented offers flexible approaches applicable to global health research across diverse settings, including resource-constrained regions where traditional funding pipelines have consistently failed. The blog references concrete implementations like Molecule's IP-NFT sale to VitaDAO while drawing from interdisciplinary perspectives spanning fintech, legal frameworks, and scientific methodology. It probably includes some straightforward definitions from sources like Investopedia to help biotech folks understand the concepts. While it hasn't gotten much academic citation action yet since it's pretty new, it's getting traction with actual biotech practitioners according to LinkedIn engagement metrics, which honestly matters more for practical implementation anyway.|
|Weidener, L., & Boltz, L. (2025). Challenges of DAOs in decentralized science: a qualitative analysis of expert interviews. SSRN preprint (May 2025).|This source uses interviews with ten DeSci DAO leaders, making it one of the first empirical studies of operational challenges in science DAOs. It identifies key problems including talent scarcity, fragmented decision-making, and lack of accountability, with direct quotes from DAO operators describing specific failures. The paper argues that DeSci DAOs need to blend decentralized elements with traditional structures to succeed, suggesting improvements like expert oversight committees.<br><br>This source addresses the risks section of my research question by showing operational problems could limit DeSci's effectiveness. It reveals pure decentralization might reduce efficiency where expertise and coordination matter, and warns DAOs can create new power imbalances if wealthy token holders dominate decisions. These insights identify practical hurdles global health DeSci initiatives would face.<br><br>The paper cites Weidener & Spreckelsen for DeSci principles and references organizational management literature suggesting traditional structures solve coordination problems DAOs struggle with. It includes both historical examples of DAO failures and community voices through JocelynDAO citations, creating a balanced view of limitations. Though new, DAOs are already implementing its recommendations for structured oversight and improved onboarding.|
|Jocelyn DAO. (2023). Why DeSci is not yet perfect? Top 7 challenges. Medium (Feb 22, 2023).|This source lists several challenges holding back DeSci like accessibility problems, poor academic integration, governance issues, and profit-driven research focus. It argues that despite DeSci's potential, these issues need fixing for it to succeed. The author takes a critical but constructive approach, offering suggestions while sharing insider perspectives from the DeSci community. This article shows how DeSci funding models might exclude scientists in poorer regions and could fund bad research if not designed well. It warns that profit motives might ignore important health topics that don't make money. The suggestions for fixing these problems help me look at both good and bad sides of using DeSci for global health funding. The article comes from someone's personal experience but connects to bigger debates happening in science and crypto communities. Academic researchers have started citing it in their papers, showing it matters beyond just crypto fans. Some DeSci groups are already trying to fix the problems it points out by adding expert review and making their systems easier to use.|
|Kiani, L. (2025, May 8). Beyond cryptocurrency, how blockchain is transforming science, research and biotech funding. Signals Blog. [https://www.signalsblog.ca/beyond-cryptocurrency-how-blockchain-is-transforming-science-research-and-biotech-funding/](https://www.signalsblog.ca/beyond-cryptocurrency-how-blockchain-is-transforming-science-research-and-biotech-funding/)|This source examines blockchain's impact on science funding, particularly in biotech. While I couldn't access the full article, related discussions show growing interest across scientific and crypto communities. Kiani likely explores how DAOs and NFTs give researchers alternatives to traditional grants that typically exclude certain groups. I can use this to understand DeSci's practical applications rather than just theoretical potential. Related sources indicate these technologies enable patient communities to directly fund relevant research and help scientists outside elite institutions secure funding. Examples like Molecule's IP-NFT model and VitaDAO launching Matrix Biosciences demonstrate real-world implementation of these approaches.The article probably balances tech optimism with implementation challenges, noting that despite blockchain's potential for transparency, adoption barriers remain significant. Institutional interest from the EU and Newcastle University's cryptocurrency funding experience shows this isn't just crypto-enthusiast hype but a legitimately emerging funding avenue worth exploring.|
